                  My Name is Izzat Hasan. I was born and raised in Homer Glen, IL. I currently live with my Mom, Dad, and 2 sisters. Growing up, I would visit my family in Jordan every summer. During those visits, I tried my best to learn how to speak and write Arabic. Thankfully, I was able to pick up the language quickly and I am now fluent in Arabic.
